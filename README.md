What is We Can See You?
We Can See You is a horror game/stealth game that relies on audio and the player using an in game device to see from the perspective of the enemies to navigate the world and complete tasks.

How it works?
The player has a phone in their hand that they can pull up and view the monsters perspective.
Each monster has a camera the player can tap into and see their perspective.
Only one view can be seen at a time.
The monsters will have another visual indicator to see if they have found you or not. But unfortunately for the player if they are seeing these cues then it is likely time to start running.
If multiple monsters are in the area. Their perspectives become linked once the player has been found. The player will need to navigate to avoid all monsters without dying.
